# As soon as you make a Suggestion, your opponents, in turn, try to 
# prove it false. 
# 
# The first to try is the player to your immediate left. 
# This player looks at his or her cards to see if one of the three cards 
# you just named is there. 
#  - If the player does have one of the cards named, 
#    # he or she must show it to you and no one else. 
#  - If the player has more than one of the cards named, 
#    # he or she selects just one to show you. 
#
# If that opponent has none of the cards that you named, then the chance 
# to prove your Suggestion false passes, in turn, to the next player 
# on the left. 
#
# As soon as one opponent shows you one of the cards that you 
# named, it is proof that this card cannot be in the envelope.

# End your turn by checking off this card in your notebook. 
#(Some players find it helpful to mark the initials of the player 
#who showed the card.) 
# If no one is able to prove your Suggestion false, you may either 
# end your turn or make an Accusation now.
